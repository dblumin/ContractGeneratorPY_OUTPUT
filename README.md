# ContractGenerator

### Installation Instructions

* Windows:
  * Simply download ContractGenerator.exe and put it wherever is most convenient (it doesn't matter where the application is stored or run from)

* MacOS:
  * Download dist.zip and place it wherever you want the ContractGenerator installed to (doesn't have to be where you keep the file to actually run the application). Make this somewhere you won't lose track of, so you can easily remove/update the application in the future.
  * Double-click dist.zip to unzip it. Once everything is unzipped into the dist folder, you can delete dist.zip
  * Inside the dist folder, you will find the ContractGeneratorLauncher file. You can either run it from this folder, or move it wherever is convenient for you.
   
### Usage Notes
  
* When you first launch the application, you will be redirected via your default browser to link a Google account. Make sure you use your OneTick email for authentication, or the program will not be able to download required files from the drive. If you are using an appropriate account and still have issues, ensure you have been given permissions to view all required files. If the authentication is successful, you you only need to do this once.
* Before actually generating any contracts, you should create an output folder where you want them generated to. When you launch the application, use the "Output Directory" widget to select the appropriate folder. Unless you choose to use a different folder in the future, you will only need to do this once.
